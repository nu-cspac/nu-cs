# Zoom Office hours
## Useful Guides

Below are several guides with helpful tips about using zoom effectively. Below each link is a brief summary of key takeaways.

### [Frictionless Zoom Teleconferencing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ehsGO_lKjlyZF3uEUwgdmPCrTLUvkEy06NdFlm24wWE/edit)



* Having a single persistent link that is open to anyone from Northwestern makes minimal barrier to entry.
* For poor connections, try sharing video but using cellular for audio.
* You can get a persistent link to create a meeting with you (a “personal meeting id”) by [logging in to your zoom profile](https://northwestern.zoom.us/) and looking under “Personal Meeting ID”.


### [Online Lecture/Classes Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10pFoWzhZppuV1Ri1RmpCUR-30n354-DDjObettdHN_s/edit)
* Suggests acquiring a headset for optimal audio quality.
* You want your voice to sound not just intelligible but crystal clear (like a radio broadcast); this will reduce students’ listening fatigue and keep them engaged throughout a long lecture.



### [Chat Protocol for Remote Lectures](https://www.spinellis.gr/blog/20200406/)

* A chat protocol in the Zoom chat for question and answers during lecture can allow for effective interactions.
* The suggested protocol enables queueing of questions.




## General Notes
* TAs should set up their own meetings so they can be the host. This allows them to customize the settings for the meeting.
* [Setup persistent zoom URL for OH](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362843-Personal-meeting-ID-PMI-and-personal-link)
* Allow only authenticated users. Potentially set a password - make sure that the password is easy and well broadcasted to all students.
* Include the the authenticated password link on canvas
* The zoom whiteboard can be an effective method for sharing equations, drawings, and diagrams.  


### Caveats to be aware of.
* Recording a zoom meeting records *everything* in the meeting, including student video and voice. Thus, recording an office hour session may entail consent issues that you should consider before recording office hours.

# Proposed Teaching Modalities

We have found that there are broadly four approaches to meeting with students remotely.
Below are notes on each of the different approaches and their pros and cons.
We believe that no single one of these methods works well for all students, so we suggest trying a mixture. Having said that, we understand that your time is valuable (and limited!)


### Method: Appointment Slots
* Using the [Google appointment feature](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/190998?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en), setup 10-15 minute appointment slots which students can sign up via google calendar
* Link the persistent URL on the appointment slot
#### Pros
* Allows Students to plan their day
* Guarantees dedicated one-on-one time
#### Cons
* Limited number of spots, 
* does not scale
* Can be intimidating for students
* Students don’t get to overhear other questions for students, no discussion
### Method: Open Office Hour
* This method helps simulate an in person office hours, we believe it gives students more flexibility
* Setup waiting room for scheduled meeting (note a waiting room cannot be added once the meeting has started)
* Enable “play enter/exit chime” in “Manage participants” window
   * Externally track when students enter and exit to form a queue
*  An invariant: A student in the waiting room == a student has a question. Assume anybody in the waiting room needs help now. Students should not hang out in the waiting room if they don’t have questions at the moment.
#### Pros
* Approximates office hours in person
* Allows students to ask multiple questions in a given session
#### Cons
* Students may not be served
* Students don’t necessarily have dedicated reserved windows of time
* Office hours could last a very long time


### Method: Discussion based office hour
* All students join with their microphones and videos on
* The office hour is based around discussions. 
* Students pose questions in zoom chat, and raise hands if they want to contribute to the discussion
* TA moderates discussion
#### Pros
* Enables students to interact with each other on material
#### Cons
* Specific questions may not be covered
* Students may not have the same comprehension on the material


### Method: Recitation (Prepared TA Lecture)
#### Suggestions for TAs
* Have audio and video muted by default for students entering meetings
#### Suggestions for Students to follow
* Keep your audio and video muted at all times, unless you’re asking a question.
* To ask a questions, use the “raise hand” feature of zoom. Raising a hand will send a pop-up to the meeting host.
