# An Unofficial Latex Format for Northwestern Doctoral Thesis

Congratulations! 
It must have been a very challenging experience along your journey to the final stage of your PhD.
To make your job easier, I (Hyeok) and previous PhD students (Enrico, Brian, Lukas) have passed this format.
Feel free to use and update.

## How to use it?

Download it and edit the `main.tex`. There are some descriptions about how to use it. 
If you have used Overleaf or Latex before for your paper submissions, you'll be able to figure out how to use it.
Good luck!

## NOTE

While it generally follows [the dissertation format requirements](https://www.tgs.northwestern.edu/academic-policies-procedures/dissertation-publication/dissertation-formatting-requirements/), 
it is not official at all, and not approved by Northwestern University Library or other related authorities. 
Use with some caution. 

## Maintenance

If any, it will be all voluntary work. No one has a long-term responsibility for maintaining this format files.
I (Hyeok) am not doing this on behalf of CSPAC, and I don't really have a plan for maintaining and tailoring for you.
Please don't ask/bother CSPAC people for this. 
You are Computer Scientists!
